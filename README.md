# ChuMaiNichi

A personal dashboard for CHUNITHM and maimai DX arcade rhythm-game players. Tracks daily play counts, ratings over time, and uses an AI agent to suggest songs for efficient DX rating improvement.

> *ChuMaiNichi* = CHUNITHM + maimai + 毎日 (*mainichi*, "every day") — *playing daily*.

## Features

- **Daily play tracking** — automated scraper logs every play to PostgreSQL.
- **Rating history** — DX rating and CHUNITHM rating tracked per day.
- **AI agent with tool use** — chat with an LLM that can query your database and recommend songs.
- **Song suggestion engine (maimai)** — greedy algorithm that finds the minimum-effort path to a target DX rating.
- **Discord notifications** — daily summary of play count, rating changes, and money spent.
- **Password-gated** — frontend prompts for a password on first visit; all `/api/*` routes require it.
- **Zero cost** — runs on free tiers only (Vercel Hobby, Neon free, GitHub Actions free minutes).

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite + TypeScript |
| Hosting | Vercel (Hobby plan) |
| API routes | Vercel serverless functions |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL (serverless) |
| Daily scraper | Python 3.12 + Playwright (Firefox, headless), managed with `uv` |
| Per-song scraper | [leomotors/chuumai-tools](https://github.com/Leomotors/chuumai-tools) Docker images |
| AI | OpenAI-compatible API with tool use (server-side, streaming); Gemini via its OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Notifications | Discord webhooks |

## Architecture

```
Browser (React SPA on Vercel)
    │
    ├── POST /api/query   → Neon PostgreSQL (read-only SQL)
    ├── POST /api/chat    → OpenAI-compatible API (tool use, streaming)
    └── POST /api/refresh → GitHub API (trigger workflow_dispatch)

GitHub Actions (cron + manual trigger)
    ├── scrape-daily.yml       → Playwright scraper → Neon → Discord
    └── scrape-user-data.yml   → chuumai-tools Docker → Neon

Neon PostgreSQL
    ├── daily_play    — one row per date, both games combined
    └── user_scores   — JSONB snapshots from chuumai-tools
```

All secrets stay in Vercel env vars and GitHub repo secrets. The browser never sees connection strings or API keys.

## Setup

Three free accounts (GitHub, Neon, Vercel) plus one SEGA account. Optionally: Discord and an OpenAI or Gemini key.

### 1. Fork this repository

Click **Fork** on [Phudit-2547/ChuMaiNichi](https://github.com/Phudit-2547/ChuMaiNichi).

### 2. Edit `config.json` in your fork

```json
{
  "games": ["maimai", "chunithm"],
  "currency_per_play": 40
}
```

Set `games` to the subset you play. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

### 3. Create a Neon database

Sign up at [neon.com](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/signing-up), create a project, and copy the **pooled connection string** from the dashboard. It looks like:

```
postgresql://<user>:<password>@ep-<id>-pooler.<region>.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

You'll reuse this string in both GitHub secrets (step 5) and Vercel env vars (step 7).

### 4. Create a Discord webhook (optional)

Follow Discord's [Intro to Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). Create a webhook in the channel where you want daily notifications, then copy its URL. Skip this if you don't want Discord notifications.

### 5. Set GitHub Actions secrets

In your fork: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Add:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon connection string from step 3 |
| `SEGA_USERNAME` | Your SEGA ID |
| `SEGA_PASSWORD` | Your SEGA password |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook from step 4 (optional) |

Step-by-step walkthrough (originally for a predecessor repo — *steps are identical, substitute ChuMaiNichi for Chunimai-tracker*): [Fork Chunimai Tracker Repository and Set Up Actions Secrets](https://scribehow.com/viewer/Fork_Chunimai_Tracker_Repository_and_Set_Up_Actions_Secrets__pLeL8YA5S4Kg-7uqWRPD7Q).

### 6. Trigger the first scrape

On your fork: **Actions → scrape-daily → Run workflow**. The first run:

- Executes `init.sql` to create the tables (idempotent, safe to re-run).
- Logs into your SEGA portal and scrapes today's play count and rating.
- Sends a Discord notification if the webhook is configured.

Wait ~2 minutes for the run to finish.

### 7. Deploy to Vercel

Import your fork at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and set these env vars during import:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Same Neon connection string |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | A strong password — the dashboard will prompt for it |
| `GITHUB_PAT` | Fine-grained PAT with `actions: write` scope on your fork |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | `<your-username>/ChuMaiNichi` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` **or** `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Pick one AI provider |

See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) for the full reference including optional vars.

Step-by-step walkthrough: [How To Deploy A Vercel Project With Environment Variables](https://scribehow.com/viewer/How_To_Deploy_A_Vercel_Project_With_Environment_Variables___i1qFMICTWKNabjopvyPQw).

### 8. Visit your dashboard

Open the URL Vercel assigns (`<your-project>.vercel.app`). Enter the `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` from step 7 when prompted — it's stored in `localStorage`, so you only enter it once per browser.

## Configuration

### `config.json`

Single file at repo root, committed to git. Edits require a redeploy to take effect.

```json
{
  "games": ["maimai", "chunithm"],
  "currency_per_play": 40
}
```

| Field | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `games` | `["maimai"]`, `["chunithm"]`, or both | Which scrapers run, which heatmap columns render, and whether the maimai song-suggestion AI tool is available |
| `currency_per_play` | Integer (THB) | Used in spending calculations shown on the dashboard and in Discord notifications |

**Do not put secrets here.** This file is public.

### Environment variables

**Vercel (server-side; never exposed to the browser):**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Neon PostgreSQL connection string |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | yes | Bearer-token password for all `/api/*` routes |
| `GITHUB_PAT` | yes | Fine-grained PAT for triggering `workflow_dispatch` |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | yes | `<your-username>/ChuMaiNichi` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | one of two | OpenAI-compatible key (used if `GEMINI_API_KEY` not set) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | optional | Custom base URL; defaults to OpenAI |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | one of two | Google Gemini key (takes priority over OpenAI) |
| `AI_MODEL` | optional | Model override; default `gemini-2.5-flash` (Gemini) or `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI) |

**GitHub Actions secrets:**

| Secret | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Same Neon connection string |
| `SEGA_USERNAME` | yes | SEGA ID |
| `SEGA_PASSWORD` | yes | SEGA password |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | optional | Enables daily Discord notifications |

## How it works

**Daily scrape (22:00 Asia/Bangkok).** GitHub Actions runs a Playwright scraper that logs into your SEGA portal, reads today's play count and rating, and upserts one row per date into `daily_play`. A Discord webhook sends the summary.

**Manual refresh.** Clicking **Refresh scores** on the dashboard calls `/api/refresh`, which triggers `scrape-user-data.yml`. That runs the `leomotors/chuumai-tools` Docker scrapers to fetch your full song-score history and stores it as a JSONB snapshot in `user_scores`. Takes ~2 minutes.

**AI chat.** The right-sidebar chat streams responses from `/api/chat`, which proxies to an OpenAI-compatible API with two tools available to the model:

- `query_database` — generates and runs read-only SQL against your Neon database.
- `maimai_suggest_songs` (maimai only) — given your current scores, finds songs where extra practice most efficiently raises your DX rating (greedy search over top-35 old + top-15 new).

## Roadmap

- [ ] CHUNITHM song suggestion (maimai done; CHUNITHM deferred)
- [ ] SEGA news ingestion — scrape `info-chunithm.sega.com` and `info-maimai.sega.com`, cache as JSON/Markdown, and expose to the AI agent as tool-accessible knowledge (event schedules, version updates, song additions)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation — shortcuts for toggling the chat panel, opening settings, triggering refresh, and focusing the chat input
- [ ] Update AI system prompt — surface ingested SEGA news, refine tool-use guidance, and tune tone/response length
